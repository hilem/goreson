# GORESON: GO-RE-(j)SON

## Example Go-lang / RethinkDB JSON API
* note: This was initially created Q4/14 to support a mobile event sharing app. Initially created to explore Golang and RethinkDB. It exists as an extension of dancannon's work on (GoRethink_TodoDemo)[https://github.com/dancannon/GoRethink_TodoDemo]. The original backend setup is no longer in use, though I thought this repository might serve some value as an example backend setup. Enjoy. *

Currently the following controllers exist (Each are documented within):
  - Users
  - Events
  - Messages
  - Participants

## TODO:
  - Make controllers more generic
  - Further testing
